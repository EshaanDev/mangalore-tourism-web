     "DESCRIPTION": "Quite far-off from the main city and had difficulties in getting radio cab. We hired an auto for round trip. The end part of the travel to Someshwara Beach is through relatively narrow roads and rural like areas. When we visited, the beach had limited crowd, further the place seems to be unhurt by commercial activities, had limited availability of conveyance, shops, snacks etc. As a result, this beach could a good place for spending some peaceful time. The adjacent Someshwara temple is a must visit at this place. As far as Sea, it is very rough with large waves; scary and unsafe for swimming or even venturing into the sea. The seashore also has big slippery rocks, though people climb on the rocks for a closer view of rough sea but could be unsafe as well. The beach is however clean and provides a good option for a leisurely stroll along the beach under cool breeze. To summarize, this beach provides options for a closure view of rough sea under a peaceful setting and visit to adjacent Someshwara temple etc.",
